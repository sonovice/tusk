# Roundtrip Testing Tasks

Tasks generated from MusicXML → MEI → MusicXML roundtrip tests. Each task documents a missing conversion, unsupported element, or discrepancy found during testing.

**Legend**: `[ ]` = pending, `[x]` = done

**Workflow**: The `tusk_roundtrip.sh` script both implements existing tasks AND generates new ones when issues are discovered during roundtrip testing.

## Initial Roundtrip Infrastructure

### Setup
- [x] Create roundtrip test harness in `crates/formats/musicxml/tests/roundtrip.rs`
- [x] Add test helper: parse MusicXML → convert to MEI → convert back to MusicXML
- [x] Add comparison logic to detect differences between input and output
- [x] Run roundtrip tests on all fixtures in `tests/fixtures/musicxml/`

### Basic Fixtures
- [x] Roundtrip test: `hello_world.musicxml`
- [x] Roundtrip test: `scale.musicxml`
- [x] Roundtrip test: `durations.musicxml`
- [x] Roundtrip test: `chords_and_rests.musicxml`
- [x] Roundtrip test: `high_divisions.musicxml`
- [x] Roundtrip test: `directions.musicxml`
